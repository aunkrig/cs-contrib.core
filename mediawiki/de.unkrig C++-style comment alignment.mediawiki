Verifies that C++-style comments ('<code>// ...</code>') are correctly aligned.
 <p>
 C++-style comments must appear on the same column iff
 <ul>
   <li>They appear in immediately consecutive lines, and
   <li>All of these lines are of the same 'kind' (see below)
 </ul>
 Each line of code relates to one of the following 'kinds':
 <ul>
   <li>A line which contains only a C++-style comment
   <li>A line which contains only a switch label ('<code>case x:</code>' or '<code>default:</code>') and a C++-style comment
   <li>Any other line
 </ul>
