Verifies that C++-style comments ("<code>// ..&#46;</code>") are correctly aligned.
<p>
C++-style comments must appear on the same column iff
<ul>
  <li>They appear in immediately consecutive lines, and
  <li>All of these lines are of the same 'kind' (see below)
</ul>
Each line of code relates to one of the following 'kinds':
<ul>
  <li>A line which contains only a C++-style comment
  <li>A line which contains only a switch label ('<code>case x:</code>' or '<code>default:</code>') and a C++-style comment
  <li>Any other line
</ul>
